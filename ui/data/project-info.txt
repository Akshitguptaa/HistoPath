Project Title
Histopathologic Detection of Metastasis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [cite: 166, 167]

Project Objectives
1. Implement a CNN-based model trained on the PatchCamelyon dataset. [cite: 198]
2. Extend patch-level predictions to slide-level analysis by aggregating results. [cite: 199]
3. Generate interpretable heatmaps to localize tumor regions. [cite: 200]
4. Develop a user-friendly web-based platform. [cite: 201]
5. Provide a chatbot assistant to guide users. [cite: 202]
6. Improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce pathologist workload. [cite: 203]

Key System Features
- **Web-Based User Interface:** An intuitive platform for uploading histopathology patches, viewing model predictions, and analyzing tumor localization with interactive heatmaps. [cite: 186, 201, 220, 221, 222]
- **Integrated Chatbot Assistant:** A virtual assistant to provide real-time explanations of predictions, evaluation metrics, and system functionality to guide users. [cite: 202, 223, 225, 226, 227]
- **Clinical Decision Support:** The system functions as an AI-aided second opinion, helping to reduce manual workload and improve diagnostic confidence. [cite: 228, 229]
